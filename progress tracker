-upload to GitHub and attempt GitKraken

Nov 27
-include recommended variables from PBL and attempted calculator

Dec 1
- fixed NA pop total for 2013, there are 3 NA values in the weights when transferring from file to flow > only issue with FV 

Follow up
>work on PBL later once I get response about large file

Dec 4
- split file, test PBL tmrw?
- graphs done > still need title

NEXT

>test half year combined /

Dec 28
- fix errors

Dec 30 
- filter DHHGAGE > 3 bc doesn't support under 20 yrs old 
- fixed missing NA

2) strat: year, SDCGRES, filter: GEN_07= 4,5, SDCFIMM=1
3) strat: year, SDCGRES, filter: SMK_204>=20, SDCFIMM=1
4) strat: year, SDCGRES, filter: PACDEE= <=1.5, SDCFIMM=1
5) strat: year, SDCGRES, filter: FVCDTOT<5, SDCFIMM=1
6) all five?
